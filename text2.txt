One of the best ways to ensure that a culture of security is driven throughout an institute and that sufficient interest is present for arranging security awareness training on an ongoing basis is to get buy-in from campus leaders. Those at the upper end of the hierarchy, like presidents of different societies, can be given the responsibility for driving awareness and keeping things on track, and they should report to the upper management directly. This will give institutions the best opportunity of ensuring that their security goals are balanced with other risks (lack of interests from students) their business faces. Campus leaders can arrange events like a ¡®security awareness day¡± with fun and engaging activities to keep interest high in security awareness campaigns.
Final Verdict

Security awareness provides a variety of benefits to businesses in the higher education industry. It allows them to accelerate behavioral change to reduce unnecessary cost, mitigate threats, and comply with policies. However, instead of relying on Information Security professionals to prevent infiltrations and minimize vulnerabilities, institutes should bank on the persons within to learn and digest new information about security. By taking the measures mentioned above, schools would be in a better position to create a cycle where the learning is continuous, and combined efforts result in the building of a culture of security awareness.
