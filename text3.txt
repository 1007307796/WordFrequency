Incentives can help boost behavior changes, and industries have turned to using awards to make security awareness education more interesting. For instance, higher ed schools may award prizes to students/faculty/staffers who flag a vulnerability, while the IT department may compete for a monetary incentive over who spots the most security-related vulnerabilities. The benefit of this approach is that those unintentionally engaged in unsecured activities (like using devices without anti-virus installed) will hear about best practices too. In fact, they may be motivated to take their institute¡¯s security seriously and become a part of the first line of defense against looming threats.
4. Institute-Wide Security Hygiene

An acceptable use policy, where stakeholders lockdown and sign out of devices when they¡¯re not being used, should be enforced institute-wide. Also, training programs should be set up to educate end users about the importance of strong passwords along with timely updates of devices¡¯ operating system. See what people need and establish baseline rules. These rules should be strictly followed at all times. Also, you can set up a secure portal that keeps information safe and doesn¡¯t limit activities on student-owned devices.
