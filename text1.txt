Cyber thieves have the higher education industry in their crosshairs. According to some reports, higher education accounted for 13 percent of all breaches, with only financial and healthcare firms being attacked at a greater ratio. Moreover, why shouldn¡¯t they? Personal data (of everyone from alumni to staff to faculty), academic research, and cross-institutional records provide attractive targets for adversaries.

The higher education industry has experienced several cybersecurity incidents, like:

    Database breach targeting the university¡¯s network revealed records of 287,570 affiliated personnel, students, faculty, and staff.
    Hack of a university¡¯s health system may have exposed records of more than 4 million patients.
    Ransomware cyber attack on a top university may have damaged the files stored on its systems.

If the issue is humanized, the information at risk is often that of young individuals who in the majority of instances are stepping foot in the professional world. If hackers manage to access their information, things could get ugly down the road. In fact, it could lead to identity theft and disrupt your chances of securing a mortgage, paying college fees, etc.
